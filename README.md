1. Serverless Function Setup
Purpose: The serverless function performs real-time inference to identify whether the input content (such as email text) is spam. This setup allows the application to scale automatically with demand, only using resources when required, which reduces costs and optimizes performance.

Setup Details:

Platform: AWS Lambda (alternatively, Google Cloud Functions or Azure Functions could also be used).
Model: A simple keyword-based spam detection model (or alternatively, an NLP-based model) is deployed in the serverless function.
API Endpoint: The serverless function exposes a RESTful API endpoint, which the Laravel application calls to receive spam detection responses.
Request Format: The function accepts a JSON payload structured as follows:
json

{
  "content": "Sample email or message content to check for spam"
}
Response Format: The serverless function returns a JSON response, e.g.:
json

{
  "is_spam": true,
  "message": "This content is classified as spam."
}
Security and Access Control: API Gateway (or equivalent) is configured with appropriate permissions and API keys for secure access.
2. Chatbot UI (User Interface)
Description: The Chatbot UI in Laravel provides an interactive interface where users can enter content (e.g., email text) to check for spam. This interface is powered by AJAX to ensure real-time response handling without requiring a page reload.

Features:

Real-time Interaction: As soon as users submit their content, it’s sent to the serverless inference function, and the result is displayed instantly on the UI.
Asynchronous Requests: AJAX is used to send and receive data, allowing the app to display responses from the serverless function without refreshing the page.
Dynamic Feedback: Users receive immediate feedback (e.g., “This email is spam” or “This email is not spam”) based on the serverless model’s response.
Example Code Snippet (Laravel Blade template with AJAX for real-time interaction):


<textarea id="emailContent" placeholder="Paste your email content here..."></textarea>
<button onclick="checkSpam()">Check Spam</button>
<p id="result"></p>

<script>
    async function checkSpam() {
        const content = document.getElementById('emailContent').value;
        const response = await fetch('/check_spam', {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
            body: JSON.stringify({ content })
        });
        const result = await response.json();
        document.getElementById('result').innerText = result.is_spam ? 'Spam detected' : 'Not spam';
    }
</script>
3. Usage Example
Here are sample interactions to demonstrate how the chatbot works:

Sample Query 1:

Input: "Congratulations! You have won a cash prize. Click here to claim."
Serverless Response: { "is_spam": true, "message": "This content is classified as spam." }
Displayed Result: "Spam detected"
Sample Query 2:

Input: "Hi, just confirming our meeting tomorrow at noon."
Serverless Response: { "is_spam": false, "message": "This content is not spam." }
Displayed Result: "Not spam"
Sample Query 3:

Input: "URGENT! Immediate action required to secure your account."
Serverless Response: { "is_spam": true, "message": "This content is classified as spam." }
Displayed Result: "Spam detected"
